George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?

George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. George has just been accepted into medical school, while Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Throughout the day, they get into several heated arguments. In the afternoon, they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the final moments.

<original>
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. George has just been accepted into medical school, while Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Throughout the day, they get into several heated arguments. In the afternoon, they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the final moments. The outcome depends on George's last shot. If he hits a high-value section, he wins; if he hits a low-value section, Lena wins. Thinking of Lena's difficult situation, George deliberately aims for the low-value section. He sets up his shot, and the dart lands in the low-value region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George intentionally aim for the low-value section?
